## Improvement Plan

1. Keep dependency drift visible through weekly Dependabot pull requests.
2. Keep runtime secrets out of git through the Project Health guardrail.
3. Use .editorconfig to reduce formatting churn across agents and local editors.
4. Treat this file as the lightweight audit entry for future improvements.

## Suggested Next Improvements

- Add project-specific tests to the Project Health workflow once the default branch is stable.
- Add CodeQL or language-native security scanning where the repository has a supported build path.
- Convert manual setup notes into reproducible scripts when setup steps are repeated.
- Add structured logging and health endpoints to service repositories that expose long-running APIs.
